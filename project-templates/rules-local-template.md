# Machine-Specific Rules

<!-- This file holds patterns and gotchas specific to this workstation.
     Claude Code loads it automatically from ~/.claude/rules/.

     HOW TO USE:
     1. Copy this template to ~/.claude/rules/<name>.local.md
     2. Replace the placeholder sections with your actual patterns
     3. The file is never synced — it stays on this machine only

     To promote a pattern to universal rules, use /devkit-sync promote
     or manually copy the entry into the appropriate rules file. -->

## Machine Environment

<!-- Record machine-specific paths, tool versions, or quirks here. -->

- OS: [your OS and version]
- Shell: [bash / zsh / PowerShell]
- Notable tool paths: [e.g., Python at /usr/local/bin/python3.12]

## Machine-Specific Patterns

<!-- Patterns that apply only to this workstation. Use the same format
     as autolearn-patterns.md: Category, Context, Fix, Example. -->

## Project-Specific Patterns

<!-- Patterns discovered during project work that haven't been promoted
     to universal rules yet. Include the project name for context. -->

## Temporary Notes

<!-- Short-lived reminders, debugging notes, or work-in-progress items.
     Clean these out periodically. -->
