# Project Concept Brief

**Available tokens for substitution in Kit 3 scaffolding:**

- `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` -- the project's canonical name
- `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` -- one-sentence problem statement
- `{{AUTHOR}}` -- creator's name
- `{{DEVSPACE}}` -- path to development workspace
- `{{MACHINE}}` -- development machine identifier
- `{{PROFILE}}` -- selected tech stack profile (e.g., "go-rest-api", "react-spa")

Fill this out BEFORE running Kit 3 scaffolding. Your answers drive template population and architecture decisions.

## What is this project?

<!-- One sentence description. Examples: "CLI tool for ...", "REST API that ...", "React dashboard for ..." -->

## What problem does it solve?

<!-- Who has this problem? What pain does it cause them? What happens without this solution? -->

## What does it do? (core behavior)

<!-- List the 2-3 most important things it must do. Be specific. Examples: "Accept SSH connections and tunnel traffic", "Provide live search across N million documents", "Sync configuration from git to Kubernetes cluster" -->

1.
2.
3.

## What does it NOT do? (explicit scope boundary)

<!-- What should be left out? What is explicitly out of scope? Examples: "Not a multi-tenant platform", "No persistence layer (stateless)", "Supports Linux only, not Windows" -->

## Tech stack hints

<!-- Optional but helpful: suggest the target environment. Examples: "Go CLI that runs on macOS/Linux", "Node.js backend + React frontend", "Kubernetes-native operator" -->

## Success looks like

<!-- How will you know it's working? What's the end state? What does the user get? Examples: "Bandwidth savings of 50% compared to manual config", "Deploy new services in under 5 minutes", "0 data loss on power failure" -->
