# Project-Specific Learned Patterns (Local)

This file contains patterns specific to the current project or machine.
It is NOT synced to DevKit. See `autolearn-patterns.md` for shared generic patterns.

Claude Code loads all `*.md` files from `~/.claude/rules/` automatically,
so both the shared file and this local file are active simultaneously.

## How to Use

When `/reflect` discovers a new pattern, decide:

- **Generic** (useful in any project): add to `autolearn-patterns.md` (shared)
- **Project-specific** (references project paths, types, or APIs): add here
