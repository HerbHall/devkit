# Project-Specific Gotchas (Local)

This file contains gotchas specific to the current project or machine.
It is NOT synced to DevKit. See `known-gotchas.md` for shared generic gotchas.

Claude Code loads all `*.md` files from `~/.claude/rules/` automatically,
so both the shared file and this local file are active simultaneously.

## How to Use

When you discover a platform or tool gotcha, decide:

- **Generic** (affects any project using that tool): add to `known-gotchas.md` (shared)
- **Project-specific** (references project paths, APIs, or config): add here
