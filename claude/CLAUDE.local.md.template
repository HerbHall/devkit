# Personal Claude Preferences

**NOTE**: This file should be added to `.gitignore` - it contains your personal preferences that shouldn't be shared with the team.

## My Code Style Preferences

- [Personal formatting preferences that differ from team standards]
- [Specific patterns you prefer]
- [Libraries or approaches you favor]

Example:
- Prefer async/await over promises chains
- Always use explicit return types in TypeScript
- Prefer named functions over arrow functions for top-level functions

## My Workflow Preferences

- [How you prefer to work through tasks]
- [Whether you want verbose explanations or concise responses]
- [Testing approaches you prefer]

Example:
- Run tests after every significant change
- Show me git diffs before committing
- Ask before installing new dependencies

## My Environment

- Editor: [VS Code / other]
- Terminal: [bash / zsh / PowerShell]
- Node version: [version]
- Package manager preference: [npm / yarn / pnpm]

## Personal Shortcuts & Aliases

```bash
# My custom aliases (if Claude needs to use them)
alias gst='git status'
alias gp='git push'
alias test-watch='npm test -- --watch'
```

## My Project-Specific Notes

- [Personal reminders about this project]
- [Things you're working on]
- [Known issues you're tracking]
- [Your TODO items]

Example:
- Need to refactor the auth flow once API is stable
- Performance bottleneck in data processing - profile later
- Check with team about migrating to new design system

## My Communication Preferences

- [How verbose you want responses]
- [Whether you want proactive suggestions]
- [Your tolerance for interruptions vs autonomy]

Example:
- Be concise unless I ask for explanations
- Proactively suggest optimizations when you see them
- Always ask before making architectural decisions

## Personal Gotchas to Remember

- [Things you frequently forget]
- [Mistakes you've made before]
- [Patterns you want to avoid]

Example:
- I always forget to update the changelog
- Remind me to run the full test suite before pushing to main
- I tend to over-engineer - keep me focused on MVP
