<overview>
Complete checklist of information to gather when creating new requirements. Use this after key questions to capture remaining details.
</overview>

<project_identity>
**Project Identity**

- [ ] Project name
- [ ] One-sentence description
- [ ] Project type (CLI, library, GUI, web, mobile, other)
- [ ] Target platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, cross-platform)
</project_identity>

<stakeholders>
**Stakeholders**
- [ ] Primary users (who uses this daily?)
- [ ] Secondary users (occasional users)
- [ ] Administrators (if applicable)
- [ ] External systems/integrations
</stakeholders>

<problem_space>
**Problem Space**

- [ ] Core problem being solved
- [ ] Current solution (if any) and its limitations
- [ ] Success metrics (how do we know it's working?)
- [ ] Business value / motivation
</problem_space>

<functional_needs>
**Functional Needs**

- [ ] Core features (must work for MVP)
- [ ] Secondary features (important but not critical)
- [ ] Nice-to-have features (if time permits)
- [ ] User workflows (step-by-step user journeys)
- [ ] Input/output specifications
- [ ] Data handling requirements
</functional_needs>

<non_functional_needs>
**Non-Functional Needs**

- [ ] Performance expectations (speed, throughput, latency)
- [ ] Scalability requirements (users, data volume)
- [ ] Reliability requirements (uptime, error tolerance)
- [ ] Security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- [ ] Usability requirements (accessibility, learning curve)
- [ ] Maintainability requirements (documentation, code standards)
</non_functional_needs>

<technical_context>
**Technical Context**

- [ ] Required technologies/languages
- [ ] Prohibited technologies (if any)
- [ ] Dependencies/libraries preferences
- [ ] Integration points (APIs, databases, services)
- [ ] Deployment environment
- [ ] Development environment constraints
</technical_context>

<constraints>
**Constraints**
- [ ] Timeline constraints
- [ ] Budget constraints
- [ ] Team size/expertise constraints
- [ ] Regulatory/compliance requirements
- [ ] Backwards compatibility requirements
- [ ] License restrictions
</constraints>

<explicit_exclusions>
**Explicit Exclusions**

- [ ] Features explicitly NOT in scope
- [ ] Platforms NOT supported
- [ ] Use cases NOT addressed
- [ ] Future considerations (not this version)
</explicit_exclusions>

<usage_guidance>
**How to use this checklist:**

1. Present sections one at a time or all at once based on user preference
2. Mark items as "N/A" if not applicable to project type
3. For unknown items, note as "TBD" and flag for follow-up
4. Prioritize getting core items before nice-to-haves
5. Don't block on incomplete information - document what's known
